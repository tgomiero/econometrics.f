The latest project (in progress) can be found in the econometrics main text (and PDF) folder. The file will be the same as the only PDF that appears outside of some folder.

The other folders contain R, LaTeX, PDF files that are used in the main text, and R, LaTeX, etc. code applications.

Github's PDF reader does not allow you to read hyperlinks, so you need to download the pdf to see them

I should leave the introduction of the project here, to make it easier to understand:
 Thelinear regression analysis is based on the book I used, Econometric Meth
ods by Jack Johnston, and the class notes from Econometrics 1 (and possibly
 2) that I took at FEA-USP.
 Several excerpts have been rewritten based on the main book with the aim
 of developing my writing skills in LaTeX. Similarly, the tables in the book have
 been rewritten and/or adapted in LaTeX or using Rstudio to further develop
 my skills in these environments.
 Most of the statistical calculations were carried out in Rstudio with the same
 objective. Excel was also used to clean the database and integrate with Rstudio.
 I will try to use some techniques and concepts presented in Quantitative
 Economics with R; A Data Science Approachlink. Its PDF can be easily found
 by searching online.
 The main objective here will not be to present a formal approach to econo
metrics. Instead, I will aim to provide a concise overview of the theory necessary
 to understand the topic, and proceed with practical examples using R, Excel,
 and other tools
