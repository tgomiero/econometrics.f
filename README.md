The latest project (in progress) can be found in the econometrics main text (and PDF) folder. The file will be the same as the only PDF that appears outside of some folder.

The other folders contain R, LaTeX, PDF files that are used in the main text, and R, LaTeX, etc. code applications.

Github's PDF reader does not allow you to read hyperlinks, so you need to download the pdf to see them
